My poster is a question to what our \u201cfight\u201d is meant to look like. Often, we think of revolutionary action as violent or aggressive, but what if it was soft, gentle, and caring? Instead of one big \u201cfight\u201d the revolution can look like daily radical acts of care for those in our community. I wanted my poster to serve as a reminder to me and others that community care is both necessary and revolutionary in itself. It features a group of my friends with an elder in our community playing music in a local park, the names of my mentors, and some projects from home that inspire me. As we are going to look at these posters almost every day, I wanted the poster to be the example of what I am doing this for: the joy and thriving of ALL in society.

I\u2019ve worked in community care for most of my career, as I am naturally drawn to it, but I wanted to explore topics like Machine-Learning AI, Rural Making, and Interspecies perspectives all in relation to how each can have the capacity of love. This feels particularly relevant to me as I feel we are in a time of our society where people feel disenchanted with what Western society has to offer. In a society that feels particularly \u201cloveless\u201d and somewhat hopeless, isn\u2019t it the time to explore what it really means to love \u2013 in as many forms we can imagine? With these weak signals, some areas of opportunity I would like to explore are: How can the care networks in small rural communities harnessed to secure their future? Through tech or through environmental collaboration? How could visualizing love and care from our non-human counterparts create a deeper connection to them? What does love look, feel, sound and taste (?) like at different scales of our society? Both human and non-human scales? THE LONG (Hey, if you want to get to know me and my work better, this is a WAAY better way) \u00b6 Surrounded by plants, insects, friends, and the sound of the city in the Jardin de Mariposas each of us in our class set off to build our own design space. With my new Atlas of Weak Signals cards in hand and the explanation from our lovely lecturer, Marianna Quintero , I set off to find the cards that I resonated most with. I started by drawing from the weak signal category I felt most drawn to: \u201cKill the Heteropatriarchy\u201d. I think what drew me to this category was the aggressive nature the name and how the words choice was in direct contrast to my desired focus of this masters: Radical Love and Care. (Hey, I know we got to kill/dismantle some things to make way for some radical love \u2013 but the dichotomy made me smile, ok?) Yes, I wrote myself a thesis statement \u2013 can you tell I love structure? So, if you may have read (or may not have read, I don\u2019t think I wrote that much) in my first reflection, my \u201cfight\u201d is for community care. It is largely more of a question about what it looks like to radically pursue love in a Western/Colonial society that doesn\u2019t value it. And with that fight, I think you can guess what my first and most important card is: \u201cImagining Futures that are not Western-Centric\u201d\u2026 Then came \u201cRural Futures\u201d, \u201cInterspecies Collaboration\u201d, and \u201cHuman-Machine Creative Collaborations\u201d. As you can see, I am basically just filled with questions about everything \u2013 no real answers, just a sh*t ton of questions Much of my past-work revolved around my love for people, but I want to begin exploring what it means to show acts of love to our environment and other species. Much of humanity\u2019s relationship to non-humans is purely extractive. We often see ourselves as above non-humans, not equal to, therefore many think non-humans are incapable of care and love. I want to challenge and explore this belief and am curious about what it means to love non-humans and how non-humans love us. This same thought process extends to the Human-Machine Creative Collaboration. We\u2019ve created machines to be tools of personal and individual self-serving interest. They often operate for a specific task or with baked in bias that other humans are set out to harm other humans. But what would it look like if we made machines to care? And are they even possible of doing that? Now for the card I feel that might be the most out of place: Rural Futures (I really want to work in a rural community, OK?) . I believe there is so much potential in rural area \u2013 in both research AND project work. The close-knit community networks make for an interesting case study in how community must care for each other when resources are less accessible. Additionally, in the context of Canada and the Indigenous people who\u2019s land it is stolen from \u2013 I think there is a lot of potential to better understand the non-western ideologies around how people see themselves as part of the environment and how they could potentially use tech in non-extractive ways to care for their surroundings. SOOO all these weak signals are really just a vehicle to feed my obsession about what it means to love and care for each other. \u201cImagining Futures that are not Western-Centric\u201d works as the overarching theme, as love and care is not particularly valued in our current society (kind of weird for a society that is so obsessed with it though?) , and to imagine love as our way forward is (to me) inherently radical. Then \u201cRural Futures\u201d, \u201cInterspecies Collaboration\u201d, and \u201cHuman-Machine Creative Collaborations\u201d provide a rich research and experimentation space to understand what love really looks like and what it could be.

It feels so human, (academically human) to name how we experience our environment. This assignment speaks to a deeply reflective, silly, but very human part of my brain that enjoys over-analysis (though years of therapy and decolonial thinking is helping me step away from the \u201cover\u201d part of that statement) .

I worked with people with cognitive disabilities, helping design their daily services in hope we can help them build a better life. The thing is, cognitive disability is so diverse \u2013 one design that works for one person, could ABSOLUTELY fail for another.

A lot of them were sticky and bouncy, which I REALLY enjoyed, as a tactile loving person.

The journalists talked about how after WWII the Netherlands faced a large famine where many people faced severe starvation. Scientists then studied the ancestors of those who faced this trauma and found many different health issues, including diabetes, high-blood pressures, and even schizophrenia. You can listen to it here Not really being a biology person I thought this was a great place to start looking into trauma, history, and the effects of it on our biology. Unfortunately, this is a burgeoning field (damn, so I can\u2019t just have my trauma\u2019s cured from science?) , and while I wanted to research DNA specifically, it was quite difficult to pinpoint one exact article. There may not be that many papers \u2013 but check out what some amazing scientists are doing So fittingly I thought \u201cLet\u2019s look at LOVE\u201d (can you tell I am obsessed?) and can you guess what hormone that lead me to? OXYTOCIN! Colloquially known as the \u201clove hormone\u201d, this hormone is released into the hypothalamus to biologically facilitate childbirth and attachment . In National Geographic\u2019s \u201cIs Maternal Instinct Only for Moms? Here\u2019s the Science\u201d , a grandmother/researcher tested her and her husband\u2019s oxytocin levels before and AFTER meeting their infant grandchild. What she found is that her oxytocin level\u2019s spiked 63% after the visit while her husband\u2019s only 23%. BUT do not fret (it isn\u2019t like men don\u2019t feel attachment to their infants) after prolonged exposure to the grandchild, her husband\u2019s oxytocin levels also raised to 63%. This casual experiment demonstrated that our instinct to parent and care for others is BIOLOGICAL \u2013 that there are biological elements in how we care for each other, beyond social constructs. So next that got me interested in what happens if we introduce oxytocin to situation where this is no instinct to care. This is where the Youtube video from before comes in, following that line of thought, I found an article that was about the effect of injecting oxytocin into virgin mice and how it influenced them to care for young that was not their own . When exposed to lone baby mice outside of the nest virgin female mice either ignore them or cannibalized them. But researchers found that if these virgin mice are injected with oxytocin, they began to show mothering instincts and would care for the baby mice and bring them back to the nest. The virgin mice were paired with both with mothering mice and other virgin mice to see learned behaviors could effect the mice as well. When the virgin mice were paired with mothing mice, their caring instincts appeared much faster, even in the mice who weren\u2019t injected with oxytocin. While learned behaviors played a large role in the caring instincts, they also found that virgin mice who were injected with oxytocin and were paired with other virgin mice still showed caring instincts and retrieved lost pups. This finding, for me, is very important as it shows there is something innate in nature for animals to care for offspring, even when it isn\u2019t their own. This makes me wonder how much is our ability to care is up to our hormones and how much is societal influence. What could therapy possibly look like if we take into account our hormones? Could hormone treatment become something that treats things other than physical illnesses and gender dysphoria?","title":"Bio & Agro"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%26Agro/#bio-agro","text":"","title":"Bio &amp; Agro"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%26Agro/#2-weeks-in-bio-and-i-have-no-idea-what-is-happening","text":"OK I am not going to lie, these weeks were a little hard for me.

This is where the Youtube video from before comes in, following that line of thought, I found an article that was about the effect of injecting oxytocin into virgin mice and how it influenced them to care for young that was not their own . When exposed to lone baby mice outside of the nest virgin female mice either ignore them or cannibalized them. But researchers found that if these virgin mice are injected with oxytocin, they began to show mothering instincts and would care for the baby mice and bring them back to the nest. The virgin mice were paired with both with mothering mice and other virgin mice to see learned behaviors could effect the mice as well. When the virgin mice were paired with mothing mice, their caring instincts appeared much faster, even in the mice who weren\u2019t injected with oxytocin. While learned behaviors played a large role in the caring instincts, they also found that virgin mice who were injected with oxytocin and were paired with other virgin mice still showed caring instincts and retrieved lost pups. This finding, for me, is very important as it shows there is something innate in nature for animals to care for offspring, even when it isn\u2019t their own. This makes me wonder how much is our ability to care is up to our hormones and how much is societal influence. What could therapy possibly look like if we take into account our hormones? Could hormone treatment become something that treats things other than physical illnesses and gender dysphoria?","title":"(the answer is probably no)"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWIdeas/","text":"Living With Your Own ideas \u00b6 How many times do we encounter care and love in a day? \u00b6 For a day I tried to record all the times I saw, felt, experienced care and love. When I had that fuzzy feeling (I wish love was that easy to explain) I took out my phone and snapped a 2 second video in an attempt to record it. Going in to the experiment I assumed: 1. That I would definitely know love and care when I saw it 2. By the end of the day, I would feel really content with what I encountered (TBH I really didn\u2019t think too much about what I would be seeing) I started the experiment and recorded the things in the morning I do to take care of myself and my roommate (because self-care) . I dressed in all clothes that made me feel loved - things that were given to me from friends and family. Then once ready, I set out to be a LOVE DETECTIVE ! OK so let\u2019s just say, being a love detective is ROUGH! There is a lot of ugly and neglect out there, especially in the tourist areas where I unfortunately started my day. It was so rough that I began doing the opposite - recording all the moments of neglect. video to be added soon \u00b6 Actually, all the things I saw became a little overwhelming - to the point I was feeling quite negative or melancholy by the end of the day. That was until I sat down and looked at all videos, because it turned out that I actually recorded more moments of love and care than I moments of neglect! When I went to compile the video, I found that it greatly boosted my mood! I saw so many small moments of joy throughout the day - yet I let the negative take most of my mindspace. That in itself says a lot about the impact of neglect, I think it has great ability to overshadow our ability to see love. BUT after the experiment this is generally what I learned: 1. I do not have a firm grasp on how I define love and care for myself 2. Care is a very subjective thing - what I might think is caring, might be really harmful for others 3. Many systems exist in a paradox of care. For example, the metro was created for the people of a city to easily get around BUT many entrances to metros are not wheelchair accessible 4. Most instances of care I recorded were between people - but I didn\u2019t know if what I was actually capturing was care","title":"Living With Your Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWIdeas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living With Your Own ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWIdeas/#how-many-times-do-we-encounter-care-and-love-in-a-day","text":"For a day I tried to record all the times I saw, felt, experienced care and love.
