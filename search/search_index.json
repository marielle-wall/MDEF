My poster is a question to what our \u201cfight\u201d is meant to look like. Often, we think of revolutionary action as violent or aggressive, but what if it was soft, gentle, and caring? Instead of one big \u201cfight\u201d the revolution can look like daily radical acts of care for those in our community. I wanted my poster to serve as a reminder to me and others that community care is both necessary and revolutionary in itself. It features a group of my friends with an elder in our community playing music in a local park, the names of my mentors, and some projects from home that inspire me. As we are going to look at these posters almost every day, I wanted the poster to be the example of what I am doing this for: the joy and thriving of ALL in society.

I\u2019ve worked in community care for most of my career, as I am naturally drawn to it, but I wanted to explore topics like Machine-Learning AI, Rural Making, and Interspecies perspectives all in relation to how each can have the capacity of love. This feels particularly relevant to me as I feel we are in a time of our society where people feel disenchanted with what Western society has to offer. In a society that feels particularly \u201cloveless\u201d and somewhat hopeless, isn\u2019t it the time to explore what it really means to love \u2013 in as many forms we can imagine? With these weak signals, some areas of opportunity I would like to explore are: How can the care networks in small rural communities harnessed to secure their future? Through tech or through environmental collaboration? How could visualizing love and care from our non-human counterparts create a deeper connection to them? What does love look, feel, sound and taste (?) like at different scales of our society? Both human and non-human scales? THE LONG (Hey, if you want to get to know me and my work better, this is a WAAY better way) \u00b6 Surrounded by plants, insects, friends, and the sound of the city in the Jardin de Mariposas each of us in our class set off to build our own design space. With my new Atlas of Weak Signals cards in hand and the explanation from our lovely lecturer, Marianna Quintero , I set off to find the cards that I resonated most with. I started by drawing from the weak signal category I felt most drawn to: \u201cKill the Heteropatriarchy\u201d. I think what drew me to this category was the aggressive nature the name and how the words choice was in direct contrast to my desired focus of this masters: Radical Love and Care. (Hey, I know we got to kill/dismantle some things to make way for some radical love \u2013 but the dichotomy made me smile, ok?) Yes, I wrote myself a thesis statement \u2013 can you tell I love structure? So, if you may have read (or may not have read, I don\u2019t think I wrote that much) in my first reflection, my \u201cfight\u201d is for community care. It is largely more of a question about what it looks like to radically pursue love in a Western/Colonial society that doesn\u2019t value it. And with that fight, I think you can guess what my first and most important card is: \u201cImagining Futures that are not Western-Centric\u201d\u2026 Then came \u201cRural Futures\u201d, \u201cInterspecies Collaboration\u201d, and \u201cHuman-Machine Creative Collaborations\u201d. As you can see, I am basically just filled with questions about everything \u2013 no real answers, just a sh*t ton of questions Much of my past-work revolved around my love for people, but I want to begin exploring what it means to show acts of love to our environment and other species. Much of humanity\u2019s relationship to non-humans is purely extractive. We often see ourselves as above non-humans, not equal to, therefore many think non-humans are incapable of care and love. I want to challenge and explore this belief and am curious about what it means to love non-humans and how non-humans love us. This same thought process extends to the Human-Machine Creative Collaboration. We\u2019ve created machines to be tools of personal and individual self-serving interest. They often operate for a specific task or with baked in bias that other humans are set out to harm other humans. But what would it look like if we made machines to care? And are they even possible of doing that? Now for the card I feel that might be the most out of place: Rural Futures (I really want to work in a rural community, OK?) . I believe there is so much potential in rural area \u2013 in both research AND project work. The close-knit community networks make for an interesting case study in how community must care for each other when resources are less accessible. Additionally, in the context of Canada and the Indigenous people who\u2019s land it is stolen from \u2013 I think there is a lot of potential to better understand the non-western ideologies around how people see themselves as part of the environment and how they could potentially use tech in non-extractive ways to care for their surroundings. SOOO all these weak signals are really just a vehicle to feed my obsession about what it means to love and care for each other. \u201cImagining Futures that are not Western-Centric\u201d works as the overarching theme, as love and care is not particularly valued in our current society (kind of weird for a society that is so obsessed with it though?) , and to imagine love as our way forward is (to me) inherently radical. Then \u201cRural Futures\u201d, \u201cInterspecies Collaboration\u201d, and \u201cHuman-Machine Creative Collaborations\u201d provide a rich research and experimentation space to understand what love really looks like and what it could be. If you want to check out my full Design Space, I encourage you to follow this link to my miro! I will do my best to update it throughout the semester, so peep into it when you can! BUT since I now vaguely know what I wanna look into, I think next steps involve research how I should define love in my work \ud83d\ude0a","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-AtlasofWeakSignals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term1/02-AtlasofWeakSignals/#the-short-i-know-we-are-all-short-on-time","text":"For my design space the weak signals I chose were: Imagining Futures that are not Western-Centric Rural Futures Interspecies Collaboration Human-Machine Creative Collaborations I hope to explore each weak signal in relation to my fight \u2013 community care and love.

It feels so human, (academically human) to name how we experience our environment. This assignment speaks to a deeply reflective, silly, but very human part of my brain that enjoys over-analysis (though years of therapy and decolonial thinking is helping me step away from the \u201cover\u201d part of that statement) . It\u2019s interesting to reflect on what roles we inhabit while trying to discover new (maybe just new to us) things about our world. I\u2019ve had the great luck to dip my toes in all four of the outline roles of prototyping \u2013 being maybe a combination my curious attitude, design school, and having amazing mentors. (having a depth of experience is great- but where do I start?!) I think, most recently, I\u2019ve used \u201cRole 2: Prototyping as a means of Inquiry\u201d. Mainly as this was how our team at my old job approached most of our work \u2013 creating designs that can help us understand, empathize, and empower (oooh I don\u2019t like that word) the people we worked with. I worked with people with cognitive disabilities, helping design their daily services in hope we can help them build a better life. The thing is, cognitive disability is so diverse \u2013 one design that works for one person, could ABSOLUTELY fail for another. This means we would use communication tools, I suppose we can call them prototypes here, to help better discover about people\u2019s lives. The tool themselves were not the objects of our attention, the people were/are. From card matching, visual calendars, emotion charting, and soooo many more prototypes \u2013 we would create quick tools to better understand what people wanted and how we might get there. Role 4: Prototyping as a Vehicle for inquiry is something I feel I use every day in my life \u2013 though particularly in my pottery practice. Though I am not writing any academic papers about potting (YET! ), I use this art form to try hands on experiment and learn more about the medium. With each finished pot, I have documented process of where I have come from and what I can try next. Pottery is a slow art form, so it makes you move along with the pace of the environment. While there is a certain level of control, it is a game you play with the mud (thanks to Marc for describing it this way to me recently!) . Sometimes in the process of making something wrong, you begin to learn how you could possibly make it right (or just different) the next time you attempt it \u2013 all a process I cherish more than the finished product itself. To me each piece of work is a commemoration of the process that went into it \u2013 mistakes and all! Now moving forward, I think Role 1 and Role 3 give me the most pause. Role 1, as I do not consider myself a scientific person \u2013 I am a little to worried to make a declaration of a hypothesis and then see it be proven wrong (ahhh pride you get in the way once again!) . Then Role 3: Prototyping as a Research Archetype \u2013 which to me seems very artsy and not very practical (?) . In a way, it feels like a speculation, rather than any type of solution \u2013 which I suppose is something I also what to grow in.
