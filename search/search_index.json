Can you promise yourself that you won\u2019t love people/things/institutions that don\u2019t love you back? Can you promise yourself that you will love radically & openly - unafraid of the pain love leads to but expectant of the great joy it can create? Can you promise yourself that you will share that love everyday if you can? Can you promise me that you will send me a valentine in return if you ejoyed mine? send me an email ( marielle.wall@students.iaac.net ) me what you want when it comes to love.

I started by drawing from the weak signal category I felt most drawn to: \u201cKill the Heteropatriarchy\u201d. I think what drew me to this category was the aggressive nature the name and how the words choice was in direct contrast to my desired focus of this masters: Radical Love and Care.

Much of humanity\u2019s relationship to non-humans is purely extractive. We often see ourselves as above non-humans, not equal to, therefore many think non-humans are incapable of care and love. I want to challenge and explore this belief and am curious about what it means to love non-humans and how non-humans love us.

They often operate for a specific task or with baked in bias that other humans are set out to harm other humans. But what would it look like if we made machines to care? And are they even possible of doing that? Now for the card I feel that might be the most out of place: Rural Futures (I really want to work in a rural community, OK?) . I believe there is so much potential in rural area \u2013 in both research AND project work. The close-knit community networks make for an interesting case study in how community must care for each other when resources are less accessible. Additionally, in the context of Canada and the Indigenous people who\u2019s land it is stolen from \u2013 I think there is a lot of potential to better understand the non-western ideologies around how people see themselves as part of the environment and how they could potentially use tech in non-extractive ways to care for their surroundings. SOOO all these weak signals are really just a vehicle to feed my obsession about what it means to love and care for each other. \u201cImagining Futures that are not Western-Centric\u201d works as the overarching theme, as love and care is not particularly valued in our current society (kind of weird for a society that is so obsessed with it though?) , and to imagine love as our way forward is (to me) inherently radical.

I was sick for a large part of the course content, and I most definitely found my attention waning when I was in class. Maybe it was just an off two weeks for me or maybe my intention currently lies elsewhere, but I did have fun doing experiments. One thing I am sad I missed because I was so sick was making of the biomaterials! I got to see the aftermath of their making, which was very fun! A lot of them were sticky and bouncy, which I REALLY enjoyed, as a tactile loving person. I will say, event though I wasn\u2019t in the class, I had lovely friends recount it to me and they said somethings that made me really think about biomaterials in a different way. I always believed that biomaterials are this big cool thing for the planet (I really knew nothing about them honestly\u2026) but they told me that even if they are \u201cbiological\u201d they are still a source of creating more \u2013 depleting more. This made me wonder if we can ever really be \u201csustainable\u201d, if even biological materials create waste\u2026 Scientific Articles - Do I understand you? \u00b6 (the answer is probably no) \u00b6 Years ago, I heard an episode of a race & culture podcast on NPR, Code Switch where they talked about how racism and trauma affect our genomes. The journalists talked about how after WWII the Netherlands faced a large famine where many people faced severe starvation. Scientists then studied the ancestors of those who faced this trauma and found many different health issues, including diabetes, high-blood pressures, and even schizophrenia. You can listen to it here Not really being a biology person I thought this was a great place to start looking into trauma, history, and the effects of it on our biology. Unfortunately, this is a burgeoning field (damn, so I can\u2019t just have my trauma\u2019s cured from science?) , and while I wanted to research DNA specifically, it was quite difficult to pinpoint one exact article. There may not be that many papers \u2013 but check out what some amazing scientists are doing So fittingly I thought \u201cLet\u2019s look at LOVE\u201d (can you tell I am obsessed?) and can you guess what hormone that lead me to? OXYTOCIN! Colloquially known as the \u201clove hormone\u201d, this hormone is released into the hypothalamus to biologically facilitate childbirth and attachment . In National Geographic\u2019s \u201cIs Maternal Instinct Only for Moms? Here\u2019s the Science\u201d , a grandmother/researcher tested her and her husband\u2019s oxytocin levels before and AFTER meeting their infant grandchild. What she found is that her oxytocin level\u2019s spiked 63% after the visit while her husband\u2019s only 23%. BUT do not fret (it isn\u2019t like men don\u2019t feel attachment to their infants) after prolonged exposure to the grandchild, her husband\u2019s oxytocin levels also raised to 63%. This casual experiment demonstrated that our instinct to parent and care for others is BIOLOGICAL \u2013 that there are biological elements in how we care for each other, beyond social constructs. So next that got me interested in what happens if we introduce oxytocin to situation where this is no instinct to care. This is where the Youtube video from before comes in, following that line of thought, I found an article that was about the effect of injecting oxytocin into virgin mice and how it influenced them to care for young that was not their own . When exposed to lone baby mice outside of the nest virgin female mice either ignore them or cannibalized them. But researchers found that if these virgin mice are injected with oxytocin, they began to show mothering instincts and would care for the baby mice and bring them back to the nest. The virgin mice were paired with both with mothering mice and other virgin mice to see learned behaviors could effect the mice as well. When the virgin mice were paired with mothing mice, their caring instincts appeared much faster, even in the mice who weren\u2019t injected with oxytocin. While learned behaviors played a large role in the caring instincts, they also found that virgin mice who were injected with oxytocin and were paired with other virgin mice still showed caring instincts and retrieved lost pups. This finding, for me, is very important as it shows there is something innate in nature for animals to care for offspring, even when it isn\u2019t their own. This makes me wonder how much is our ability to care is up to our hormones and how much is societal influence. What could therapy possibly look like if we take into account our hormones? Could hormone treatment become something that treats things other than physical illnesses and gender dysphoria?","title":"Bio & Agro"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%26Agro/#bio-agro","text":"","title":"Bio &amp; Agro"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%26Agro/#2-weeks-in-bio-and-i-have-no-idea-what-is-happening","text":"OK I am not going to lie, these weeks were a little hard for me.

This made me wonder if we can ever really be \u201csustainable\u201d, if even biological materials create waste\u2026","title":"2 Weeks in Bio and I have no idea what is happening"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%26Agro/#scientific-articles-do-i-understand-you","text":"","title":"Scientific Articles - Do I understand you?"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%26Agro/#the-answer-is-probably-no","text":"Years ago, I heard an episode of a race & culture podcast on NPR, Code Switch where they talked about how racism and trauma affect our genomes. The journalists talked about how after WWII the Netherlands faced a large famine where many people faced severe starvation. Scientists then studied the ancestors of those who faced this trauma and found many different health issues, including diabetes, high-blood pressures, and even schizophrenia. You can listen to it here Not really being a biology person I thought this was a great place to start looking into trauma, history, and the effects of it on our biology. Unfortunately, this is a burgeoning field (damn, so I can\u2019t just have my trauma\u2019s cured from science?) , and while I wanted to research DNA specifically, it was quite difficult to pinpoint one exact article. There may not be that many papers \u2013 but check out what some amazing scientists are doing So fittingly I thought \u201cLet\u2019s look at LOVE\u201d (can you tell I am obsessed?) and can you guess what hormone that lead me to? OXYTOCIN! Colloquially known as the \u201clove hormone\u201d, this hormone is released into the hypothalamus to biologically facilitate childbirth and attachment . In National Geographic\u2019s \u201cIs Maternal Instinct Only for Moms? Here\u2019s the Science\u201d , a grandmother/researcher tested her and her husband\u2019s oxytocin levels before and AFTER meeting their infant grandchild. What she found is that her oxytocin level\u2019s spiked 63% after the visit while her husband\u2019s only 23%. BUT do not fret (it isn\u2019t like men don\u2019t feel attachment to their infants) after prolonged exposure to the grandchild, her husband\u2019s oxytocin levels also raised to 63%. This casual experiment demonstrated that our instinct to parent and care for others is BIOLOGICAL \u2013 that there are biological elements in how we care for each other, beyond social constructs. So next that got me interested in what happens if we introduce oxytocin to situation where this is no instinct to care. This is where the Youtube video from before comes in, following that line of thought, I found an article that was about the effect of injecting oxytocin into virgin mice and how it influenced them to care for young that was not their own . When exposed to lone baby mice outside of the nest virgin female mice either ignore them or cannibalized them. But researchers found that if these virgin mice are injected with oxytocin, they began to show mothering instincts and would care for the baby mice and bring them back to the nest. The virgin mice were paired with both with mothering mice and other virgin mice to see learned behaviors could effect the mice as well. When the virgin mice were paired with mothing mice, their caring instincts appeared much faster, even in the mice who weren\u2019t injected with oxytocin. While learned behaviors played a large role in the caring instincts, they also found that virgin mice who were injected with oxytocin and were paired with other virgin mice still showed caring instincts and retrieved lost pups. This finding, for me, is very important as it shows there is something innate in nature for animals to care for offspring, even when it isn\u2019t their own. This makes me wonder how much is our ability to care is up to our hormones and how much is societal influence. What could therapy possibly look like if we take into account our hormones? Could hormone treatment become something that treats things other than physical illnesses and gender dysphoria?","title":"(the answer is probably no)"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWIdeas/","text":"Living With Your Own ideas \u00b6 How many times do we encounter care and love in a day? \u00b6 For a day I tried to record all the times I saw, felt, experienced care and love.

Reality was hard. A slap in the face that I don\u2019t belong. A realization that I don\u2019t think I ever will. A realization that there is so much more work to do to make this industry safe for racialized and marginalized folks. Thought this week would be different \u2013 expectations are a bitch\u2026 Hey Holon, I know you are the ones responsible for marking this. I hope you understand that I will not be doing the assignment as it was assigned, but instead explaining and expanding upon why I was so upset during the first class and disengaged for the rest of the week. I hope you see this post as a gift, not as hostile or as an attack as I am often misinterpreted as when I speak (being racialized, on the spectrum, and queer has a lot of great things but this isn\u2019t one of them\u2026) . This is an opening for reconciliation, an opportunity for us to use love to understand each other. I hope this post can be the beginning of a relationship for us. (Please not my use of brackets are often to clarify, make a joke, and break some seriousness - as we all need some levity now and then) Background - Me & Doing this Master \u00b6 I was (and am!) lucky to be raised in generous, humble, beautiful communities. Ones that taught me many hard truths about the world (see racism, ableism, homophobia, and transphobia) but ones that also taught me the beauty of worlds when we lead with understanding, respect, care, abundance, and love. I hold these communities & worlds dearly. They are the reason I am & they are the reason I continue to do work. But they are worlds that exist in stark protest to the capitalistic world created by Europe, whiteness, and its colonizing powers. Therefore they are worlds that already live in the apocalypse, operating with less resources than those who abide by the ruling class. Unfortunately, living & working in worlds like this has meant that I have seen community members, family, & friends struggle to survive (let alone disfruta vida\u2026) . I have lost folks because of this forced apocalypse - lives that should not be gone but are due to false scarcity created by colonialism and capitalism. These losses are a large reason I continue to work, because I know they are preventable and I am angry they are continuing to happen. So a masters discussing emergent futures - this seemed like a way forward. A way to put my academic skills to use and gain more to bring back to my communities. I had been working in service/system design in Canada, but felt stuck in the industry there (it\u2019s tiny & all the design jobs are in tech) . I saw this masters and the interesting work happening in Europe and thought that this might be a way forward. Unfortunately, starting this masters has been disappointing. The people are great - but it really lacks diversity in the educators and references. All perspectives are from a European one, futures already existing in the one Europe has imagined for the world (and let facts be facts, Europe colonized the world, there are Black, Indigenous, and POC educators out here) . Week after week, I saw no one who looked like my loved ones or me in the industry and it was discouraging. But then the week of community engagement came up\u2026 Let\u2019s talk about \u201cthe incident\u201d \u00b6 Out of all the weeks we had for this semester, I was the most excited for this one. Community engagement came out of Black, Indigenous, and Queer communities. I thought if anything, this is the week where the worlds that I love can be referenced. This is the week we can talk about colonialism and racism. This is the week we can talk about futures where my loved ones and I even exist. But be damned, I didn\u2019t even make it into the first hour before the frustration boiled over. Let\u2019s be clear, it wasn\u2019t the stats that made me upset and it wasn\u2019t that I was feeling bad (but hey the shooting at ClubQ did just happen) . It was the lack of care and context in the presentation that made me upset. It wasn\u2019t just you, Markel, that I was upset at. You were just unfortunately the presentation that tipped me over the edge. I\u2019ve sat through presentation-after-presentation of people telling us the world is bad - only focusing on the outcome and not the reasons. Them telling us if we don\u2019t do anything different, we are headed to the apocalypse - ignoring that many of us are already there. Now, if you don\u2019t hold space and explicitly acknowledge the fact that marginalized folks are living in the apocalypse when you share those states and are transparent you are only showing them to folks who may not have the lived experience to know - it\u2019s tone deaf. I know your reasoning is that we are privileged students to be in that classroom, but that was a bold assumption about our upbringings, not knowing the sacrifices we made to be here and what communities we bring with us to the space. Then we had to do introductions. This is something that has really caused me problems in this masters. Everytime we introduce ourselves, I am always the odd one out. I am the ONLY one who says their pronouns, pronouns that are notably different from others (I use they/them pronouns) . Everyday, I am misgendered - and honestly, people having to think about their pronouns when they introduce themselves actually does help people use them correctly. So those were only the first slides\u2026. Then the slide about how Holon does work came up and Markel vocally said that most of your work is based on feminist literature, but didn\u2019t reference the literature at all. This was the time and opportunity to bring in references - use without telling us where it came from is just colonialism. Say their names, give reverence to the folks that paved your way - this to me is what is deeply important to community work. This is where I visibility started crying - now I had been crying beforehand, but I wiped away those tears because I hoped it would get better. I did think about leaving, not sharing that I was really hurt by what was going on. But I knew that would be a disservice. I wanted you to see that you hurt me. I was, and am, done hiding my tears in front of systems and people who have caused harm (the idea that we must hide our emotions is a colonial one, and not representative of who we are as people) . It was time for the class to see this and have this discussion - a discussion that had been happening behind closed doors between the Black and POC members in the class. This is where I feel I should apologize, though. I unintentionally used this as an opportunity to start this conversation. I don\u2019t think you deserved the delivery of how I communicated at that time, as it was particularly venomous. I apologize for how I brought up the conversation, it should\u2019ve been done with more care. That being said, I still stand by what I said and my decisions to leave afterwards. I also believe I am owed an apology and reconciliation from Holon and specifically Markel. How the situation was dealt with during and after the incident was not well handled. I chose to leave the class, as I felt you did not actively listen to what I had to say and tried to dismiss me by \u201cthanking\u201d me for my opinion (which honestly isn\u2019t an opinion- it is fact) . This may not have been your intention - but has long been a tactic of white people to silence POC. I am also angered that the class afterwards made time to talk about what happened, but no effort has been made by Holon to reach out to me, the person who was hurt. Then the next day at the beginning of the lecture, Markel asked in front of the whole class, where I was. Which made me feel called out and alienated - almost like you were scared of me. This has been the case for most of my life, when I speak out, people I speak out against act like they are afraid of me - often making me feel less than human, like a monster. I am know I am none of those things, but I don\u2019t feel I was treated with the care I deserved as person (I don\u2019t think many of us are treated with the care we deserve, unfortunately) . Then when I did arrive, Markel came up to me and asked me if I was \u201cfeeling better\u201d. Which again, felt patronizing. Like it was my feelings were the problem for the incident in the first place. By now, I hope you understand that is not the case and see my pain as justified. I walked away from this week truly disheartened, not to mention, that after this incident IAAC\u2019s follow up was both traumatizing , racist , and made me contemplate leaving the masters and design industry. Ok, so where do we go from here? \u00b6 I know we talked at the design dialogues, and that our conversation was amicable yet awkward. Even after that talk, I cannot say that I hold no hard feelings, in fact, I am still hurt about how all of this was carried out. I have to admit, I would like a verbal apology - but more importantly I want a commitment from Holon to do better. I am not sure what \u201cdoing better\u201d will mean to the firm and to each of you individually. I do not know your experience (or you very much for that manner) , but I know many people in Europe have not had these types of conversations about colonization, racialization, and oppression before. By the amount of tiring and basic questions I get from my European peers (though I love them very much, it is a lot of labour) , it has been very evident (& extremely disappointing) to me that many people here are at the very beginning of this discussion (which to me is insane because HEY EUROPE you started this) . BUT by writing this post, I am hoping to extend an arm and start dialogue between the both of us. Maybe not particularly on what \u201cdoing better\u201d means, but as an opportunity for us to reconcile and move forward. As I am sure this was not a pleasant experience for you either. Please see this post as not a call out, yet a call in: an opportunity to talk and to build. I hope to use this post and whatever comes out of it as my submission for this week - which I think would be far more meaningful than what was asked to be submitted. I hope you see this in this manner as well - that I do not mean to shame or punish with what I write. This is just me being transparent and vulnerable, expectant that there will be beauty to come from this. I hope to just lead with love. Please take your time to read/re-read this post and discuss what your actions will be next. If I do not hear from you (either individually or as a firm) by the end of January, I will assume that no further action is desired, which would be disappointing. I do hope and believe, thought, I will hear from you. I am whole-heartly awaiting your response. I wish you love, beauty, and joy.

Everyday, I am misgendered - and honestly, people having to think about their pronouns when they introduce themselves actually does help people use them correctly. So those were only the first slides\u2026. Then the slide about how Holon does work came up and Markel vocally said that most of your work is based on feminist literature, but didn\u2019t reference the literature at all. This was the time and opportunity to bring in references - use without telling us where it came from is just colonialism. Say their names, give reverence to the folks that paved your way - this to me is what is deeply important to community work. This is where I visibility started crying - now I had been crying beforehand, but I wiped away those tears because I hoped it would get better. I did think about leaving, not sharing that I was really hurt by what was going on. But I knew that would be a disservice. I wanted you to see that you hurt me. I was, and am, done hiding my tears in front of systems and people who have caused harm (the idea that we must hide our emotions is a colonial one, and not representative of who we are as people) . It was time for the class to see this and have this discussion - a discussion that had been happening behind closed doors between the Black and POC members in the class. This is where I feel I should apologize, though. I unintentionally used this as an opportunity to start this conversation. I don\u2019t think you deserved the delivery of how I communicated at that time, as it was particularly venomous. I apologize for how I brought up the conversation, it should\u2019ve been done with more care. That being said, I still stand by what I said and my decisions to leave afterwards. I also believe I am owed an apology and reconciliation from Holon and specifically Markel. How the situation was dealt with during and after the incident was not well handled. I chose to leave the class, as I felt you did not actively listen to what I had to say and tried to dismiss me by \u201cthanking\u201d me for my opinion (which honestly isn\u2019t an opinion- it is fact) . This may not have been your intention - but has long been a tactic of white people to silence POC. I am also angered that the class afterwards made time to talk about what happened, but no effort has been made by Holon to reach out to me, the person who was hurt. Then the next day at the beginning of the lecture, Markel asked in front of the whole class, where I was. Which made me feel called out and alienated - almost like you were scared of me. This has been the case for most of my life, when I speak out, people I speak out against act like they are afraid of me - often making me feel less than human, like a monster. I am know I am none of those things, but I don\u2019t feel I was treated with the care I deserved as person (I don\u2019t think many of us are treated with the care we deserve, unfortunately) . Then when I did arrive, Markel came up to me and asked me if I was \u201cfeeling better\u201d. Which again, felt patronizing. Like it was my feelings were the problem for the incident in the first place. By now, I hope you understand that is not the case and see my pain as justified. I walked away from this week truly disheartened, not to mention, that after this incident IAAC\u2019s follow up was both traumatizing , racist , and made me contemplate leaving the masters and design industry.","title":"Let\u2019s talk about \u201cthe incident\u201d"},{"location":"term1/07-CommunityEngagement/#ok-so-where-do-we-go-from-here","text":"I know we talked at the design dialogues, and that our conversation was amicable yet awkward. Even after that talk, I cannot say that I hold no hard feelings, in fact, I am still hurt about how all of this was carried out. I have to admit, I would like a verbal apology - but more importantly I want a commitment from Holon to do better. I am not sure what \u201cdoing better\u201d will mean to the firm and to each of you individually. I do not know your experience (or you very much for that manner) , but I know many people in Europe have not had these types of conversations about colonization, racialization, and oppression before. By the amount of tiring and basic questions I get from my European peers (though I love them very much, it is a lot of labour) , it has been very evident (& extremely disappointing) to me that many people here are at the very beginning of this discussion (which to me is insane because HEY EUROPE you started this) . BUT by writing this post, I am hoping to extend an arm and start dialogue between the both of us. Maybe not particularly on what \u201cdoing better\u201d means, but as an opportunity for us to reconcile and move forward. As I am sure this was not a pleasant experience for you either. Please see this post as not a call out, yet a call in: an opportunity to talk and to build. I hope to use this post and whatever comes out of it as my submission for this week - which I think would be far more meaningful than what was asked to be submitted. I hope you see this in this manner as well - that I do not mean to shame or punish with what I write. This is just me being transparent and vulnerable, expectant that there will be beauty to come from this. I hope to just lead with love. Please take your time to read/re-read this post and discuss what your actions will be next. If I do not hear from you (either individually or as a firm) by the end of January, I will assume that no further action is desired, which would be disappointing. I do hope and believe, thought, I will hear from you. I am whole-heartly awaiting your response. I wish you love, beauty, and joy.

This is for a multiplicity to reasons I went through IT these last two weeks (check my \u201cWhat I Created\u201d section) It was a lot of long sessions without breaks and my attention-deficit-self can\u2019t handle people speaking at me for 2 hours straight (honestly give me a 5 minute-break every 45 and I should be good) It was too much content without enough hands on learning Now number 3 isn\u2019t here to call people out or anything, just some real-talk from one facilitator/educator* to another. Lots of people in this course came here to learn some hands on skills to bring back to our communities & sitting in a classroom learning about the theoretical isn\u2019t really it. We went to our undergrad, we sat through lectures where profs talked at us, we listened to the people who loved university a little bit too much (cough cough this was me \ud83d\ude43 - I talked/talk too much) . But we came to this masters to learn hands on skills - like honestly that is what was sold to us - and I just don\u2019t think we got it out of this week, you know? Now, I am actually a person who loves theory. Big reader, listener, writer (feeling haver, etc.) but I came out of this week with still no real practical skills around creating my own algorithms (big ask) , tweaking existing algorithms (medium ask), or experimenting with multiple different algorithms (doable ask) . For me, a lot of the stuff we delved into was pretty high-level. Even as a child of the internet (thank you tumblr) , I found following along very difficult - add having no breaks for almost 2 hours = impossible task. So if I am to organize my thoughts for a brief moment, here is a list of things I think would be great to tackle when you do this the next time around Honestly, assume that most of us have no knowledge on AI and go from there. Maybe even ask beforehand if people in the class have background in computer-science and use them as peer-resources Challenge yourself to explain AI in one slide or less then add complexity (start simple and build BABY) I would actually try to do this challenge with each topic TBH Sit down and think about how we could practically learn the skills and ideas that were put on the slide. Here are some quick ideas find a really buggie AI, let us play around with it, and then have us talk about the pitfalls Teach us about the \u201cif\u201d & \u201celse\u201d statements that make up AI, give us a really simple one, get us to guess what the simple algorithm could be And these are just some content based things that come off the top of my head! I honestly am not paid to help build course content (but I could be \ud83d\ude09) , so I\u2019m going to stop there because I have to keep some secrets to myself. BUT also, I do have some accessibility tips (free of charge) Give a specific outline of what you\u2019re going to go over Add in lots of breaks for people to digest the information Add trigger warnings on videos/sounds that might be harmful I am looking at you Threshold Video! As someone with visual sensitivities, I definitely could\u2019ve used a heads up there - it actually sent me into overstimulation and I had to take a break for 30 mins and lie on the floor to calm down. Even though I was really interested in this presentation Know accessibility can be the last thing on people\u2019s minds when you do presentations - but please try to think of it throughout! When something triggers someone, you have no idea what it could cause someone. For me, it often means I have to leave class and self-sooth, meaning I lose out on class even if I want to be there (which is REALLY often). OK, now to give credit to where credit is do (Should I have used the sandwich technique?). I did leave this week with the following knowledge: AI is not like a human, it just mimics AI is not a thing we should be scared of How to use CoLab There is AI everywhere The formal definition of Datasets It\u2019s really fun to think of silly AI and go through the mental steps to build it Ram\u00f3n is a chill guy who likes to side eye \ud83d\udc40 silicon valley (same Ram\u00f3n, same) I think that\u2019s really it on my reflections - I hope it wasn\u2019t too harsh. It honestly was really interesting, just wish it was a little more digestible and a lot more hands-on! sorry my about me page isn\u2019t filled out!!
