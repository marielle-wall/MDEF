##What would you do if I told you I love you?

        That I will extend myself on behalf of your growth. (M. Scott Peck)

    That through my actions I will show you care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust. (bell hooks)

              That with all that I can, I will never neglect or abuse you. (bell hooks)



###Is that too much? I don’t know you. you don’t know me.

                            But why is it that too much? You are a being who is deserving of love - isn’t that reason enough?

            Love is hard. Love is vast. Love is intangible. Love is work.

###Love is a radical act.




##But love cannot exist without reciprocity.




##So, if I do all those things for you, can I ask you a few things in return?

    Can you promise yourself that you will love yourself gently & fully?

                    Can you promise yourself that you won’t love people/things/institutions that don’t love you back?

            Can you promise yourself that you will love radically & openly - unafraid of the pain love leads to but expectant of the great joy it can create?

                            Can you promise yourself that you will share that love everyday if you can?



##Can you promise me that you will send me a valentine in return if you ejoyed mine?

send me an email (marielle.wall@students.iaac.net) me what you want when it comes to love.

What it makes you think about. Times you felt it, times you didn’t. Times you gave it, times you protected it. How you define it.

Write/draw what feels natural. A little or a lot, signed or not, it is all up to you.
