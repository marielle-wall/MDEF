#Critical Transfeminist Design

##Deliverables
Laura informed us that there is no required deliverable for this week, but it appears that reflections are encouraged. Therefore, I will share my thoughts on the class, to the best of my recollection.

One significant takeaway from this class was the realization that "I am not alone." Many of the topics Laura discussed were subjects I frequently research and contemplate regarding design and its ethical implications. I appreciated her highlighting various individuals in the city whom I can connect with, and I look forward to engaging with her more in the future.
