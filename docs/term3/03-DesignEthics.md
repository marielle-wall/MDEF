#Design Ethics

##Deliverables
Ariel let us know that for this class all we needed to submit was a self-assessment. Here is a copy of what I sent him:

“To my own dismay, I was sick the first class. What you teach is quite important in our field, and I wish we had more sessions like it. I will be doing my self-assessment based on the second session, if that is ok.

I would give myself an 8.5/10 for the class, as I was late. That being said, reading the slides and experience this class has been a very meaningful interaction. Unfortunately within my design education, I had no formal training or classes on design ethics. This bothered me, so much so, that when I was a teaching assistant I created and facilitated a class on this topic. Additionally, I went on to do a directed studies on this, producing a set of values I try to incorporate in my work. Within my alma matter, my work was not taken seriously nor encouraged, so seeing themes that were similar (if not the same!) was validating. The lecture and slides also provided new reference matter and perspectives I will be able to dive into if I want to continue exploring this territory. For that I am quite grateful.

It was encouraging as well to see topics of care be mentioned within this sphere, as this is the area of interest within my thesis work. This is likely why I was quite engaged when I did make it into the class.”
