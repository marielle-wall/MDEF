Pretty easy exercise! The main problem I had was just when I tried to write code on my own, and there was no pitch library set up. But that was easily solved by pulling from an example already built into Arduino.

Tried a couple of other songs, which as always was fun. For me the best part was when the song would play and people in the class would sing along! Truly very cute.
