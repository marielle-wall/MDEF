### Feb 1 - Experimenting with a Buzzer

Pretty easy exercise! The main problem I had was just when I tried to write code on my own, and there was no pitch library set up. But that was easily solved by pulling from an example already built into Arduino.

Tried a couple of other songs, which as always was fun. For me the best part was when the song would play and people in the class would sing along! Truly very cute.

### Feb 2 - Building 3D Things

First, we were challenged to draw a croissant parametrically:

*(it is so cute, right??)*

Then told to explore a 3D software and I made this:

Based off of this:

And here is a video with my reflections and goofing around:

So we didn't end up figuring it out... Jordan did spend a lot of time working on it, but he wasn't able to finish it before he got busy with the baby.

Hope this is enough!

Planning to use this mold in the studio soon! LMK if you want an update *(or I can just bring it to the FabLab!)*
