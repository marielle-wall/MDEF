# Redesigning My Design Space
![](../images/term02/designspace.gif)

> [Check out my design space here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPOimLrg=/?share_link_id=865906909973)

For the most part, I liked how I originally set up my design space. I generally feel very solid in its direction and believe it is very true to who I am.

I think this rework is more about communicating my mind to others, more than anything. I feel the original *([see this page](https://marielle-wall.github.io/MDEF/term1/02-AtlasofWeakSignals/))* captures what goes on in my brain, while the updated is a sleeker versions that I could potentially share with others and get more precise feedback.

I reframed my design space to be more of a declaration of intention. When you put each section together it reads:

>Through the lens of Radical love, i am working towards imagining futures that are non-western centric. I will do this by using the following approaches: Inter-species Collaboration, co-creation, radical softness, & abundance ideology/mindset. And by exploring these following areas of interest: Environmental Sensing, Ancestral Futures, Inter-dependency, Inter-generational Justice, Disability Justice, Redesigning Habits, & Care Economies

*(ok this can definitely be copy edited to be clearer! But isn't that what next term is for?)*

##"Through the lens of: Radical Love"

Wanting to always touch on Radical Love, I made it the first item I mention. In the previous rendition, I framed my work as "Radical Love & Care". This term, I got rid of the term "Care" within this title.

*(for your reference!)*

This is as I felt I only added on "Care" because I felt others wouldn't take me as seriously if I just talked about Love. Though, throughout the last months, I have come to realize if people want to write me off because I'm talking about a subject they deem as "unprofessional" or unworthy of investigation, then those aren't the people I want to talk to.

What I am talking about is Love - care is part of Love but care along isn't Love *(you get what I am saying???)*. Love is radical and Love in itself is worthy of investigating how it can be used to create justice in a world so lacking it. I do not need to bend or wordsmith to make my work more "professional" for folks who wouldn’t want to engage anyway *(well for now that is)*.
