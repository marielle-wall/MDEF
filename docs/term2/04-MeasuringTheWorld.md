# Measuring the World

##Deliverables

###Reflection

We placed a smart citizen sensor in the classroom to monitor the environmental quality. Our hypothesis was that the MDEF classroom was a poor place for learning because of the negative environmental factors (air quality, temp, etc…). I don’t really know if we proved it scientifically, but it was a good starting point into the world of data collection!

Data science/collection, hopefully a new frontier for me some day. Unfortunately, it wasn’t this day *(cough cough)* *week*. Was in-and-out this week, particularly because i had interventions that took up a decent amount of my time, so I feel like I have very little to reflect on.

During the times I was there, I helped write and look at the data gathered through Orange. I very much enjoyed seeing how I could read and manipulate the info we got from the smart citizen sensor through that software. But honestly was quite distracted this week.

I would say, it created little references in my brain to check back on when the Data Science bug really starts to bite, though. Until then, my reflection is brief but my appreciation for the Fab Lab & all your knowledge - immense!
