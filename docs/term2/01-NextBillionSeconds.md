# The Next Billion Seconds

##Deliverables
###In the Next Billion Seconds
We were challenged to think about where we will be in the next billion seconds and I wanted to do something futuristic and sci-fi. Inspired by Micheal Deforge's comic ["Sticks Angelica: Folk Hero"](http://www.michael-deforge.com/sticks-angelica-folk-hero), I am imagining that like the self named character, Micheal Deforege, I have been buried in the ground up to my neck.

During my time buried, I have spread out into the ground. My arms and legs have become like roots throughout the earth. I cannot be pulled out of the ground because my roots run too deep – that pulling me out would destroy both me and my surroundings. I also cannot move, I am just a head in the ground. In a way I am both dead and not dead.

Here’s the picture I drew to imagine it and the poem I wrote along with it.

>in the next billion seconds
>i will be dead…
>i will not have a daily routine. i will be dead.
>i will not eat breakfast. others will eat me.

*(I am also working on a little video to answer this - but drawing takes a lot of time!)*

###Timecapsule Presentation

Google slides does not let me embed them into the website... [So here is the link to the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/107fKXGNEeSpYtFzY3p7to2Dr1ZKaNlNFXIKJXO-pcQM/edit?usp=sharing).
