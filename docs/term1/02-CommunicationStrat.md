#Communication Strategy

My Goals for Communication Strategy:
  -	It is accessible: Easy to understand and can be accessed how people need
  -	It contains joy: The content is enjoyable to read, makes people laugh, or even surprises them
  -	It is reciprocal: People can voice how they feel about the work and shape how it can look (with moderation)

Current Methods to Meet those Goals:
  -	Document through photos and videos when I am doing work
    - I forget to do this until recently
  -	Create short videos sharing what I am doing on my Instagram
    - This also challengeâ€™s me on a personal level because I hate sharing my work
  -	Keep writing and logging my reflections and interventions on the website as a record so I have the content when I need it
  -	Experiment with different delivery methods
  -	DREAM: Create a website that can change how the user needs it to be
    - Bigger font, smaller, columns, definitions
    - All in relatively simple languages
    - Shares resources as well

Things to try to reach these goals:
  -	Writing hardcopy news letters and sending them to those I care about
  -	Creating updates that look like Valentines
